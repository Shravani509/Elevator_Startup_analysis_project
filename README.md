# Elevator_Startup_analysis_project
The Startup Analysis Project aims to analyze and gain insights into startup companies by leveraging various data sources and analytical techniques. The project focuses on identifying key factors that influence startup success, funding patterns, industry trends, and geographical distributions.
This project is designed to help investors, entrepreneurs, and analysts make informed decisions by providing meaningful visualizations, statistical summaries.
 The raw data was then cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats. Following this, exploratory data analysis was conducted to uncover trends and patterns using visualizations and statistical summaries.
